<h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
I am Aravindan, a 19-year-old student from Chennai, India. I am passionate about art and technology, and I am greatly inspired by the work of <b>Vivian Maier</b> and <b>Mark Zuckerberg</b>

 Maier was a self-taught street photographer who took over 100,000 photographs in her lifetime. Her work was only discovered after her death in 2009, but it has since been acclaimed for its raw beauty and candid insights into human nature. I am inspired by Maier's creativity and her ability to capture the essence of everyday life in her photographs.

Zuckerberg is the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, one of the most influential companies in the world. He is a brilliant technologist who has revolutionized the way we communicate with each other. I am inspired by Zuckerberg's vision and his commitment to using technology to make the world a better place.

I believe that art and technology can be used to solve some of the world's biggest problems. I am excited to be a part of the movement to use these tools to create a more just and equitable world.
